# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that functions as a text editor. The application allows users to create notes or code snippets and store them with or without an internet connection. The data is stored using IndexedDB, ensuring that content is saved and retrieved even in offline mode. The app is bundled using webpack and features a service worker for caching static assets, enabling it to function offline. Additionally, it meets PWA criteria and can be installed on a userâ€™s device as an icon.

2. Enter your text in the editor.
3. Click outside the browser window or unfocus the DOM to automatically save the content.
4. To install the app, click the "Install" button to add it to your device.
